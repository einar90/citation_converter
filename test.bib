The effect of well length and rates on the recovery is examined. In addition, the paper also reports the techniques used by the different participants to calculate the inflow into the horizontal well participants to calculate the inflow into the horizontal well and the wellbore hydraulics. A variety of methods was used by the participants to model the inflow into the horizontal wells ranging from the use of productivity indices to grid refinement. A multitude of techniques was also used to calculate wellbore hydraulics while a few participants selected to represent the wellbore by a constant-pressure line sink. All participants consistently predict a decrease in the coning behavior with an increase in well length. However, variations in the predictions were observed. Although the modelling methods from different participants can be grouped into different categories, participants can be grouped into different categories, no trend in the predicted results, according to the methods used, could be observed. Introduction Recent interest in horizontal wells has been rapidly accelerating because of improved drilling technology, and the increased efficiency and economy of oil recovery operations. This paper presents a problem which deals with the effect of horizontal well lengths and rates on the recovery and selected results as submitted by the participants, compares various approaches for modelling horizontal wells in reservoir simulation, and discusses any large differences in the submitted results. This paper is the seventh in a series of comparative solution projects (CSP) dealing with different aspects of reservoir simulation. The objectives of this paper are: l. To compare predictions from different participants. 2. To compare different approaches for calculating pressure drops in the wellbore. The inclusion of wellbore hydraulics in the simulation is preferable. However, participants can also represent the horizontal wellbore by a constant-pressure line sink. 3. To compare different approaches for calculating productivity indices for a horizontal well. Participants can also use local grid refinement around the horizontal well if they so desire. P. 195}
